*Implemented Custom Drawing Tools*: Designed an interactive graphical application using the Tkinter library, enabling users to draw shapes such as lines, rectangles, ovals, and arcs, and to use tools like pencil and text.
- *Event-Driven Programming*: Utilized event-driven programming principles to handle mouse actions (e.g., motion, button press/release) for seamless user interaction.
- *Dynamic Menu Integration*: Integrated a dynamic menu system allowing users to switch between different drawing tools and perform application functions such as quitting.
- *Custom Font Management*: Employed Tkinter's font module to render text with customized font styles, enhancing the visual appeal of the drawn content.
- *Object-Oriented Design*: Structured the application using an object-oriented approach to maintain clean, modular, and reusable code.

*Key Features*:
- *Pencil Tool*: Allows freehand drawing with smooth lines by tracking mouse movements.
- *Shape Tools*: Enables drawing of lines, rectangles, ovals, and arcs with specified start and end points.
- *Text Tool*: Facilitates text insertion at specified locations with customized font settings.
